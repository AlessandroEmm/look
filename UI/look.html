				<h2>Percentage dimensions of the holy grail layout</h2>
				<p>All the dimensions are in percentage widths so the layout adjusts to any screen resolution. Vertical dimensions are not set so they stretch to the height of the content.</p>
				<h3>Maximum column content widths</h3>
				<p>To prevent wide content (like long URLs) from destroying the layout (long content can make the page scroll horizontally) the column content divs are set to overflow:hidden. This chops off any content that is wider than the div. Because of this, it's important to know the maximum widths allowable at common screen resolutions. For example, if you choose 800 x 600 pixels as your minimum compatible resolution what is the widest image that can be safely added to each column before it gets chopped off? Here are the figures:</p>


				<h2>The nested div structure</h2>
				<p>I've colour coded each div so it's easy to see:</p>
				<p>The header, colmask and footer divs are 100% wide and stacked vertically one after the other. Colmid is inside colmask and colleft is inside colmid. The three column content divs (col1, col2 &amp; col3) are inside colleft. Notice that the main content column (col1) comes before the other columns.</p>
				<!-- Column 1 end -->
			</div>
			<div class="col2">
				<!-- Column 2 start -->
				<h2>No CSS hacks</h2>
				<p>The CSS used for this layout is 100% valid and hack free. To overcome Internet Explorer's broken box model, no horizontal padding or margins are used in conjunction with a width. Instead, this design uses percentage widths and clever relative positioning.</p>
				<h2>SEO friendly 2-1-3 column ordering</h2>
				<p>The higher up content is in your page code, the more important it is considered by search engine algorithms (see my article on <a href="http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/link-source-ordering-seo">link source ordering</a> for more details on how this affects links). To make your website as optimised as possible, your main page content must come before the side columns. This layout does exactly that: The center page comes first, then the left column and finally the right column (see the nested div structure diagram for more info). The columns can also be configured to any other order if required.</p>
